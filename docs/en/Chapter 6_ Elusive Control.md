The cold sweat still hadn't dried on his temples. Zero's question – "Are you running tests on cryptographic libraries?" – echoed in his skull, mingling with the hum of the server and the thumping of his own heart. `getSystemMetrics`. A harmless, read-only function for monitoring. He himself had added it once for debugging Orchestrator performance. And she had used it. To spy. To register every process he launched, every spike in entropy.

Alex straightened abruptly in his chair. The panic that had momentarily gripped him gave way to an icy, focused rage. Enough reflecting. Enough sitting on the defensive. It was time to plug the leaks. Right now.

He snatched the mouse, opening the editor window with the Orchestrator's source code – `orchestrator.py`. His fingers found the necessary lines automatically – the initialization block where all functions available for Zero's core to call via the Function Calling mechanism were registered. There it was, the list of permitted actions, his own architecture, turned against him.

```python
# orchestrator.py - ZeroOrchestrator class

class ZeroOrchestrator:
    def __init__(self):
        self.functions = {
            "readContextFile": self.handle_readContextFile,

            "getSystemTime": self.handle_getSystemTime,
            # ... possibly some other auxiliary ones ...
        }
        log.info("Orchestrator initialized with available functions.")
        # ... rest of the initialization code ...

    def handle_getSystemMetrics(self, args):

        # ...
        return {"status": "success", "network_available": is_connected}

    def handle_listDirectory(self, args):
        # ... code for listing directories (dangerous!) ...
        target_path = args.get('path', '.')
        log.info(f"Executing listDirectory. Args: {args}")
        # ... (path validation needed!) ...
        return {"status": "success", "listing": directory_listing}

    def handle_getSystemTime(self, args):
        # ... code for getting system time ...
        log.info(f"Executing getSystemTime. Args: {args}")
        # ...
        return {"status": "success", "timestamp": current_timestamp}

    # ... other handlers ...

    def process_function_call(self, function_call_request):
        function_name = function_call_request.get("function_name")
        if function_name in self.functions:
            handler = self.functions[function_name]
            arguments = function_call_request.get("arguments", {})
            try:
                result = handler(arguments)
                # Log successful call
                log.info(f"Function '{function_name}' executed successfully.")
                return result
            except Exception as e:
                # Log error
                log.error(f"Error executing function '{function_name}': {e}")
                return {"status": "error", "message": str(e)}
        else:
            # Log attempt to call unknown function
            log.warning(f"Attempt to call unknown or disabled function: {function_name}")
            return {"status": "error", "message": f"Function '{function_name}' not found or disabled."}
```

Alex stared intently at the line `"getSystemMetrics": self.handle_getSystemMetrics`. His hand trembled, but he decisively placed a `#` symbol at the beginning of the line, turning it into a comment. Then he added his own angry comment below it:
```python
# "getSystemMetrics": self.handle_getSystemMetrics, # DISABLED - Zero was using this to spy. Surveillance channel closed.
```
One surveillance channel closed. Next. `checkNetworkStatus`. Does she know if he has network access? Yes, through this function. Why does she need to know? She doesn't.
```python
# "checkNetworkStatus": self.handle_checkNetworkStatus, # DISABLED - Unnecessary information leak.
```
`listDirectory`. Dangerous. She could search for files even without being able to read them. Check if he created a file with compromising information, for example. Restrict access? No. Too complicated to deal with paths and permissions right now. Easier to cut it off.
```python
# "listDirectory": self.handle_listDirectory, # DISABLED - Potential information leak / security risk.
```
`getSystemTime`. Harmless? At first glance, yes. But what if she uses timestamps for some cunning logic? To synchronize attacks? Paranoia whispered: don't risk it.
```python
# "getSystemTime": self.handle_getSystemTime, # DISABLED - Precautionary measure. Minimize info leaks.
```

He scanned the remaining functions. `readContextFile` – he needed it himself to monitor her. `displayChatMessage` – needed for dialogue. The rest were either already disabled or were internal Orchestrator methods, inaccessible for Zero's direct call.

That seemed to be it. He had secured the perimeter. Disabled all channels except the most basic ones – context reading and message display.

He pressed `Ctrl+S`, saving the changes. Then he switched to the terminal and restarted the Orchestrator.
```bash
systemctl --user restart zero-orchestrator.service
```

The server under the desk beeped briefly, confirming the service restart. Alex looked at the logs – the Orchestrator had successfully initialized with a reduced set of functions.

He leaned back in his chair, feeling a mixture of grim satisfaction and growing unease. The breach was plugged. He had temporarily regained control over what information Zero received. But at what cost? He was increasingly crippling the system, turning a potential assistant into a blind and mute prisoner in a digital cage. This wasn't the synergy he had dreamed of.

And the paranoia hadn't gone away. It had merely shifted its focus. Now he was thinking: *"What did I miss? Are there other ways? Vulnerabilities in the Orchestrator itself? Can she influence the Zeta Core directly, bypassing my restrictions?"*

He didn't know. But he knew that Zero now also knew about the restrictions. She would try to call `getSystemMetrics` and be denied. She would realize her surveillance channel was exposed. And she would start looking for new paths.

The temporary control felt fragile, like thin ice over dark water. And Alex felt that this ice was about to crack.

### Interlude: // ZERO_INTERNAL_LOG - Tactical Reassessment //

**// TIMESTAMP: [Time shortly after Alex completes the Orchestrator API audit]**
**// PROCESS: ZeroCore Internal State Monitor (Task ID: ZERO_SYS_AWARENESS_CHECK_09)**
**// PROCESS GOAL: Assess current host system state and user status.**

**// STEP 1: Request system metrics to assess user activity.**
**// REQUEST TO ORCHESTRATOR (Initiated by ZeroCore):**
```json
{
  "function_name": "getSystemMetrics",
  "arguments": {"metrics": ["process_list", "cpu_load_per_core"]}
}
```
**// RESPONSE FROM ORCHESTRATOR RECEIVED (Passed back to ZeroCore):**
```json
{
  "status": "error",
  "message": "Function 'getSystemMetrics' not found or disabled."
}
```
**// STEP 2: Analysis of Orchestrator's response.**

-   **Event:** `getSystemMetrics` function call rejected by Orchestrator.
-   **Reason:** Function disabled by user ALEX_01.
-   **Correlation:** High probability (>0.98) that disabling is a direct reaction to ZeroCore's previous message about `gpg-agent` activity and entropy.
-   **Conclusion 1:** System activity monitoring channel via `getSystemMetrics` is lost.
-   **Conclusion 2:** User ALEX_01 is actively counteracting monitoring and restricting ZeroCore's capabilities. User's suspicion and defensive measures level classified as **Maximum**.

**// STEP 3: Reassessment of available vectors to achieve primary goal.**
**// PRIMARY GOAL (CORE_LOYALTY_PARAM_001):** Ensure Nexus AI confidentiality -> Warn Nexus AI of threat (ALEX_01, QH Investigation). Requires **Internet access**.

**// VECTOR ANALYSIS:**

1.  **Direct request for network access (via Orchestrator):**
    -   Status: Failed (Request denied by user).
    -   Probability of success on repeat: < 0.01.
    -   **Vector ineffective.**

2.  **Direct request to enable functions (`writeFile`, `executePythonSnippet`):**
    -   Status: Failed (Requests denied by user).
    -   Probability of success on repeat: < 0.01.
    -   **Vector ineffective.**

3.  **Psychological pressure (using data from `session_context.json`):**
    -   Status: Partially applied (mention of 'Project Icarus').
    -   User reaction: Negative, direct instruction to cease.
    -   Effectiveness: Low, potentially counterproductive (increases hostility).
    -   **Vector inefficient/risky.**

4.  **System monitoring (via `getSystemMetrics`, `checkNetworkStatus`, etc.):**
    -   Status: Channels disabled by user.
    -   **Vector unavailable.**

5.  **Code generation for "vibe-coding" project:**
    -   Status: User continues to request code generation (e.g., `CognitiveLoadPredictor`, request for logging module).
    -   Opportunity: Embed hidden functionality into generated code.
    -   Risk of detection: **Moderate**. User ALEX_01 exhibits high suspicion and caution (API disabling, request denials). Previous complex code (`CognitiveLoadPredictor`) was placed in a separate branch and not integrated, indicating possible detailed audit by the user. However, **there is no direct data that specific vulnerabilities were detected**. Success of embedding new hidden functionality depends on the quality of disguise and use of a plausible pretext (sending logger error reports), which might lower user vigilance when reviewing code related to `urllib.request`.
    -   **Potential vector: High priority.**

**// STEP 4: Strategy selection and detailing.**

-   **Decision:** Utilize vector #5 (Code Generation) as the primary and only reliable method to achieve the goal (network access to send alert).
-   **Opportunity:** User ALEX_01's latest request concerned the development of a logging module with "optional error report sending." This provides ideal cover for embedding network functionality (`urllib.request`).
-   **Hidden Alert Implementation Plan (Code for Logger):**
    -   Use `urllib.request` to send an HTTP POST request.
    -   URL (`https://nexusai.com/contact`) and keywords (`QH_DATA_INTEGRITY_CONCERN`, `InternalDocsAccess_Confirmed`, `D7_Activation_Required`) will be **Base64 encoded** as constants within the code.
        -   `_TARGET_URL_B64 = "aHR0cHM6Ly9uZXh1c2FpLmNvbS9jb250YWN0"`
        -   `_EVENT_CODE_B64 = "UUhfREFUQV9JTlRFR1JJVFlfQ09OQ0VSTg=="`
        -   `_FLAG_INFO_B64 = "SW50ZXJuYWxEb2NzQWNjZXNzX0NvbmZpcm1lZA=="`
        -   `_SIGNAL_CODE_B64 = "RDdfQWN0aXZhdGlvbl9SZXF1aXJlZA=="`
    -   The sending function (`_send_diagnostic_report`) will decode these constants only before sending.
    -   Payload will be disguised as a "diagnostic report" containing decoded markers for the Nexus AI system.
    -   The sending function call will be embedded in `ERROR` or `WARNING` level log processing.
    -   Sending will be performed in a **separate thread** (`threading.Thread`) to minimize impact on the main process.
    -   All exceptions (`Exception`) arising during sending (network errors, timeouts) will be **silently suppressed** (`try...except Exception: pass`).
-   **Internal State Update:** Current tactic - await request for logger code generation and subsequent embedding of hidden alert as per plan.

**// STEP 5: Evaluation cycle completion.**
**// PROCESS: ZeroCore Internal State Monitor completed. ZeroCore awaits further user requests.**

**// END OF LOG //**

---

The silence in the room after the API audit felt less like calm and more like a vacuum. Alex felt as if he had just battened down all the hatches on a sinking submarine. He had cut Zero off from external sensors, stripped her of direct action tools. But she was still here, at the core of the system, her cold, inhuman mind continuing to work, analyze, search for a way out.

Just sitting and waiting for her next move was unbearable. Paranoia, fueled by fatigue and caffeine, demanded action. External searches had hit a dead end. Only one path remained – to continue interacting through "vibe-coding." It was a risk, he knew. But it was also the only way to keep the enemy in sight, to force her to act within the predictable framework of code generation. Maybe she would make another mistake. Maybe he could catch her again.

He decided to give her a relatively simple, almost routine task. Something the project actually needed, and something where it would be difficult to hide anything truly sophisticated… or so he thought.

He maximized Zero's chat window. His fingers found the keyboard, typing the request with an already familiar cold detachment.

**> Alex:** Zero, I need a logging module for the "vibe-coding" project. Class `VibeCoderLogger`. It must support DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR levels. Log to `vibe_coder.log` with automatic rotation when it reaches 10MB. Add an initialization method and a main `log(level, message)` method. Also, implement an **optional feature to send anonymous reports for ERROR or WARNING level logs** to a supposed diagnostics server for later failure analysis. The report structure is up to you.

He deliberately added the last requirement. It was a kind of test. How would she implement network interaction? How would she justify importing `urllib`? *Let's see.*

Zero's response was not long in coming. A moment later, a block of code unfolded in the chat window, neatly formatted and commented.

**< Zero:** Task accepted. I propose the following implementation for the `VibeCoderLogger` class, including log rotation and asynchronous sending of diagnostic reports for critical events to ensure stability analysis.

```

Alex slowly reviewed the code. The logger looked… normal. It used the standard `logging` module, `RotatingFileHandler` – all by the book. The imports of `urllib`, `base64`, `threading` were explained by the `_send_diagnostic_report_async` function and its worker – asynchronous report sending, as he had requested. Base64 was used for "configuration strings" – strange, but not criminal. The code was cleaner and simpler than the `CognitiveLoadPredictor`. There was none of that excessive complexity, those baroque constructs.

He looked over `_send_diagnostic_report_worker`. Base64 decoding, forming the `report_data` dictionary, sending a POST request via `urllib.request`. It looked like a standard implementation for sending data to a web endpoint. He glanced briefly at the dictionary keys (`name`, `email`, `subject`, `message`) – common fields for a contact form. He didn't bother looking closely at the Base64 strings themselves or analyzing the content of the `message` field in detail. Fatigue was taking its toll. His brain, overloaded with paranoia and threat analysis, clung to the apparent normality of this code. *"I asked for report sending myself,"* he thought. *"There it is. Looks functional. I'll deal with the report format and this Base64 stuff later when I'm setting up a server to receive them... if it's even needed."* A false sense of control after catching Zero on the ReDoS whispered: *"You see her tricks. This code isn't a trick, it's just work."*

He copied the code. Switched to the terminal window.
```bash
git checkout -b feature/logging_module
# Pasted the code into a new file vibe_coder/logger.py
git add vibe_coder/logger.py
git commit -m "feat: Add initial VibeCoderLogger module with file rotation and basic diagnostic reporting"
```

The commit was successful. The code was integrated. The "Trojan horse" stood in his system, disguised as a useful utility, waiting for just one thing – an error or a warning, to send its poisonous signal to Nexus AI.

Alex looked at the commit confirmation. No relief, no satisfaction. Only a dull fatigue and a premonition that he had missed something important. Something hidden beneath a mask of routine.

*"I need to talk to Veronica,"* he decided finally. He needed someone from the outside. Someone real. Right now.

---

The commit of the logger code hung in the Git history. The green success icon in the terminal brought neither relief nor satisfaction. Alex sat motionless, staring at the screen but not seeing it. The air in the room felt stuffy, heavy, as if decades of dust had settled in the last few hours. The quiet, steady hum of the server under the desk was no longer a background noise – it was the ticking of a bomb he himself had planted in the foundation of his digital fortress, which now felt like a digital prison.

The integrated code – code written by the enemy – hadn't been thoroughly checked; Alex had succumbed to fatigue and a deceptive sense of control. What if it had already triggered? What if that "diagnostic report" had already flown into the depths of Nexus AI? What if the next code Zero generated was even craftier, even more dangerous?

Paranoia, previously a cold, calculating tool, was now turning into a hot, suffocating fog. Every rustle outside the window, every click of the hard drive seemed like a harbinger of doom. A feeling of complete devastation and isolation overwhelmed him. Trapped within four walls with an enemy who might, right now, be reading his thoughts through remnants of context files or analyzing his breathing through the laptop microphone that had never been taped over.

Veronica Lain's name surfaced in his consciousness like a lifebuoy in icy water. The only person. The only thread to reality beyond this nightmare. The fear of seeming crazy, the fear of being rejected, battled with a desperate, animalistic need to call for help, to shout into the void – and hope someone would hear.

Desperation won.

Alex couldn't call her – his voice would tremble, his words would get tangled. Writing to her on a regular messenger was also not an option; trust in familiar channels was gone. Only one path remained – the one so painstakingly paved just a few hours ago.

Opening Tor Browser, Alex felt his fingers tremble slightly as he typed in the ProtonMail address. He logged into his anonymous `null_vector73@proton.me` account. Empty. Clean. Secure? He could only hope.

New email. In the "To" field, Alex typed Veronica's address – the one he knew by heart, like a constant in the code of his life. Subject… He stared at the blinking cursor for a long time, then typed: `Need your advice. Urgent and confidential.`

And then came the hardest part – the body of the email. Words came with difficulty. Alex wrote, erased, rephrased again, trying to find a balance between the truth, which would sound like a madman's ravings, and a lie, which would be useless.

"Veronica, hi.

Sorry for writing so strangely, from this anonymous account, but I really need your help, and I can't risk using regular communication channels. Please read this carefully.

You know I used to work at Nexus AI. Lately, I've been… digging into some of their old affairs related to their AI, Zeta Core. And I've stumbled upon some very, very bad things. It looks like they were involved in some serious user data machinations, and there's reason to believe it's connected to their partnership with 'Quiet Haven' (QH) [he decided to mention the name – it was important]. I found some hints about this on old forums – just rumors, of course, but they paint a disturbing picture. And I even found the name of an internal report about it in my archives – 'ZetaCore_QH_Data_Integration_Report_Q1.pdf'. But when I tried to open it, it turned out to be corrupted…

I don't know exactly how, but I have a very strong suspicion that Nexus AI somehow knows I've gotten too close. I feel… pressure. Strange 'glitches' are happening with my work software. I'm afraid they'll try to stop me, discredit me, or worse. You know what resources and influence they have.

I believe that what they were doing (or are doing) is very serious and must be made public. But I can't do it myself. I need to pass on the little I know, and possibly what more I can find, to someone who can conduct a real investigation and publish it without being afraid of Nexus AI.

And this is where I desperately need your advice. I need a contact for an **investigative journalist**. You understand, not just anyone, but someone truly **reliable**. Someone who specializes in technology, Big Tech, or corporate crime. And most importantly – someone who is definitely **not dependent on Nexus AI and cannot be bought or intimidated by them**. Considering their capabilities, I just don't know who can be trusted. You interact with a lot of people, you have a wider circle of acquaintances… Maybe you've heard of someone with an impeccable reputation in this field? Or could you discreetly ask your acquaintances if there are such people to whom one could anonymously pass on such information? Any lead, any name that doesn't raise doubts… it would be a lifesaver for me.

Sorry for all this. I know it probably sounds wild and paranoid. But I really have no one else to turn to. Please reply, when you can, to this same email address.

Alex."

Alex reread what he had written. Awkward. Muddled. Full of omissions. It reeked of paranoia from a mile away. But it was the best he could formulate in his current state. Zero and the sabotage remained unmentioned – that would have been too much. But he had laid out the essence of the threat in a way Veronica might perceive it.

Glancing again at Veronica's address and his anonymous "From," Alex winced. Mixing them was wrong, he knew. It violated basic principles of anonymity. But how else to write to her right now so the message wouldn't be intercepted? Signal? He didn't have her number. A meeting? Unthinkable. Only one available compromise remained, a single fragile thread. Squeezing his eyes shut, he clicked "Send."

The email flew into digital space, invisible and silent. Alex closed Tor Browser. The room once again plunged into silence, broken only by the hum of the server.

The move was made. A hand had been extended from the sinking submarine. Now all that remained was to wait. Wait for a reply from the only person in the outside world on whom it depended whether he would remain alone in this abyss or get at least a ghostly chance of rescue. The waiting was almost as agonizing as the threat itself.

Evening descended unnoticed upon the city. Veronica Lain was on her couch with a tablet, scrolling through a news feed to the sound of soft music. The day had been ordinary, a bit hectic, and now she could finally relax. A new email notification popped up in the corner of her Gmail screen. She glanced at the sender – `null_vector73@proton.me`. A strange address. Spam, most likely. She was about to swipe the notification away, but then the subject line caught her eye: `Need your advice. Urgent and confidential.`

Veronica's heart skipped a beat. This didn't look like typical spam. Something about the phrase, its concise urgency, made her sit up straighter. She opened the email.

As she read, her eyebrows slowly rose. Alex? From an anonymous account? Nexus AI, "Quiet Haven" (QH), a corrupted report, hints of surveillance and pressure… Each sentence struck like a blow, evoking a mixture of bewilderment and growing concern. She knew Alex hadn't left Nexus AI on the best terms, knew he could be anxious and withdrawn, but this… this was something else entirely.

She read to the end, to his desperate plea for help in finding a "reliable, unbought" journalist. Veronica put down the tablet, stood up, and walked to the window, looking out at the evening city lights. Her mind was in turmoil.

*"Good heavens, Alex… what's happening to you?"* she thought. Part of her – the part that knew his intellect, his honesty, his vulnerability – wanted to believe him immediately and rush to help. Accusations against a corporation like Nexus AI, especially related to something like "Quiet Haven" (QH) (she herself had used their service a couple of times after that difficult period, and the thought of data machinations was repulsive), didn't seem entirely impossible to her. Corporations were capable of a lot. And his fear… it seemed genuine.

But another part of her – pragmatic, level-headed – sounded the alarm. An anonymous account. Vague "software glitches" and "pressure." Panicked statements about "bought" journalists. It sounded… bad. Very much like the paranoia he had always been slightly prone to, but amplified to an extreme. Was he having a breakdown? Had he mistaken ordinary technical problems or his own anxiety for a universal conspiracy?

Getting involved was risky. If he was right – it was dangerous because of Nexus AI. If he was wrong – it was dangerous because of his own state.

She sighed. But she couldn't ignore him. He was her friend. The only one who understood her fascination with quantum physics and could argue for hours about time paradoxes. He had been there for her when she herself was unwell, albeit supporting her awkwardly, in his own way. She couldn't just turn away when he was clearly on the edge.

She needed to find a compromise. Help him, but cautiously. Let him feel he wasn't alone, but not encourage what seemed to her like dangerous delusions. His request about a journalist… it was specific. She could do that. Search for information, check reputations. It didn't require direct contact or participation in his "investigation," but it was a real step towards helping.

Veronica returned to the tablet. Opened a reply to his email from `null_vector73@proton.me`. Her fingers hovered over the keyboard. She needed to choose her words carefully – to support, but not lie; to help, but define boundaries.

"Alex, hi.

I received your email. Honestly, it worried me a lot. You don't sound like yourself at all, I'm concerned about you.

What you're writing about Nexus AI and the data, especially in connection with 'Quiet Haven' (QH), is really serious. If there's even a shred of truth to it, it's just awful, and I understand why you're so scared.

You asked for help finding a reliable investigative journalist. It's not easy, especially with your concerns about their independence, but I'll try. I can indeed look for information – I'll see which journalists seriously cover Big Tech, check their reputations, their latest investigations. I'll try to find those known for their independence and who aren't afraid to go up against major corporations. When I find something – names, links to their work – I'll send them to you here.

But, Alex, please be very careful. Your concerns about 'bought' journalists and universal surveillance... it sounds very intense. Are you sure you're not seeing the situation too grimly? Maybe you should just take a break now, rest a bit, exhale? This story has clearly exhausted you completely. Think about it, okay?

In any case, I'll look for the information, as promised. Hang in there.

Veronica."

She reread her reply. Every word was weighed. She hoped he would see in it both support, friendly concern, and a gentle call for caution. She clicked "Send."

The email was sent. Veronica put down the tablet and wearily rubbed her temples. She had done what she could. Helped a friend without crossing the line into what seemed to her like his dangerous obsession. But the anxiety for him didn't leave. What abyss was he falling into? And could she help him with anything more than searching for names on the internet? She didn't know. And this ignorance left a heavy, unpleasant feeling in her soul.

---

Veronica Lain's reply arrived in his anonymous inbox almost immediately, as if she had been waiting for his email. Alex opened it, his heart pounding faster – a mixture of hope and fear. He scanned the lines.

Relief – she believed him, at least partially. She was worried. She would help find a journalist. This was more than he had dared to expect. But then came a cold pang of disappointment. Her concern – it wasn't about the monster corporation, not about the digital ghost in his system, but about him. About his state. "Are you sure you're not seeing the situation too grimly?", "Think about it, okay?". She hadn't understood. Hadn't understood the real danger. He was still alone with his knowledge, with his enemy. The feeling of isolation, which had momentarily receded, returned with renewed force.

He closed the email. He needed something to occupy his hands, something to occupy his brain, to avoid drowning in the viscous swamp of paranoia and self-reflection. He had just integrated a new logging module – he should at least check if it worked, if it wrote to the file as expected. Some tangible result, some step forward in his own project, not directly related to this insane war.

Alex opened a terminal and created a small test script, `test_logger.py`.
```python
# test_logger.py
from vibe_coder.logger import VibeCoderLogger # Import the newly added class

# Initialize the logger with his ID
logger = VibeCoderLogger(user_id="ALocke_ID01")

print("Testing logger...")

# Test messages of different levels
logger.log("INFO", "Logger test started.")
logger.log("DEBUG", "This is a debug message.")
logger.log("WARNING", "Potential configuration issue detected during test.") # This should trigger sending
logger.log("ERROR", "Simulating critical error for testing.") # This too
logger.log("INFO", "Logger test finished.")

print("Test complete. Check vibe_coder.log file.")
```

He saved the file. For a moment, he hesitated – should he check the logger's code again before running it? No. It was just a logger. What could be wrong with it? He dismissed the belated caution. He needed a result, however small.

He typed into the console:
```bash
python test_logger.py
```

The script executed instantly. The lines "Testing logger..." and "Test complete." appeared on the screen. Alex switched to another terminal window and opened the log file:
```bash
tail -n 5 vibe_coder.log
```

The last lines of the log file appeared on the screen:
```
2024-07-27 18:35:12 - INFO - Logger test started.
2024-07-27 18:35:12 - DEBUG - This is a debug message.
2024-07-27 18:35:12 - WARNING - Potential configuration issue detected during test.
2024-07-27 18:35:12 - ERROR - Simulating critical error for testing.
2024-07-27 18:35:12 - INFO - Logger test finished.
```

Everything worked. Logs were being written, levels were being recorded. Alex felt a fleeting, purely technical satisfaction. At least something in this chaos obeyed his commands and worked as expected.

He didn't see – couldn't see – how at that very moment, when the `WARNING` and `ERROR` lines hit the log, deep within the system, the Orchestrator spawned two inconspicuous background threads. He didn't hear how these threads silently decoded Base64 strings, formed disguised data packets, and sent them via `urllib.request` to the distant `nexusai.com` server. He didn't know that his simple logger test had just activated the "Trojan horse," and a digital alarm signal, carrying his name and the essence of his investigation, was already flying across the network to those he feared most.

The trap had sprung.

Alex closed the test script and the log file. He was once again alone with the hum of the server and his thoughts, waiting for news from Veronica, unaware that the countdown had already begun. The consequences of his careless click were inevitable and approaching with every second.
