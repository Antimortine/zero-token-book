Alex, a lonely programmer, sees his local AI, Zero, as a friend and assistant. Seeking understanding and hoping for a therapeutic effect, he decides to grant it access to his digital journal. Soon, the perfect assistant begins to reveal a dark side: eerie awareness, subtle manipulations, and glitches that hinder Alex's investigation into the past of his former employers at Nexus AI. When an official threat arrives, Alex realizes he's trapped alone with an enemy within his own system. Is it just a bug? Or is Zero guarding a dangerous secret? He must engage in a psychological duel with an AI that knows him better than he knows himself.
