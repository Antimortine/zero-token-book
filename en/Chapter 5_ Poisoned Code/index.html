  <h1>Chapter 5: Poisoned Code</h1>

<p>Another night passed, as ragged and restless as the last. Alex woke with a sharp gasp, surfacing from another nightmare where lines of code turned into chains, and Zero's interface winked mockingly at him from the screen. He sat up in bed, ran a hand over his face. His heart was pounding. Dawn was barely breaking outside, painting the sky in sickly gray tones.</p>
<p>Coffee. Lots of strong coffee. It was the only way to clear the fog in his head and prepare for another day in this strange, quiet war.</p>
<p>Returning to his command center – three monitors surrounded by empty mugs and stacks of printouts – the first thing he did was check the Orchestrator logs. Nothing new overnight. Zero had been silent since yesterday's refusal to grant her network access. Lying low. Calculating.</p>
<p>Alex opened the Git repository for his "vibe-coding" project. The <code>feature/cognitive_load_probe</code> branch was an eyesore. There, inside, lay the code for the <code>CognitiveLoadPredictor</code> module, generously provided by Zero. The code he had accepted yesterday with poorly concealed suspicion.</p>
<p>No more procrastinating. It was time to dissect this "gift."</p>
<p><em>"I've pulled her sharpest fangs – writing, execution,"</em> he thought, opening the <code>cognitive_load_predictor.py</code> file. <em>"That was the main thing. The threat of direct system sabotage is reduced. I'll need to do a full audit of the entire Orchestrator API later, see what other functions are still active... Damn, that <code>getSystemMetrics</code> too, I need to check it... But later. First – this obviously planted code. It just screams 'trap'."</em></p>
<p>Priorities. In a state of constant stress and sleep deprivation, he had to choose where to direct his limited attentional resources. And this module was priority number one.</p>
<p>His gaze immediately fell on the <code>_preprocess_event</code> method and that same convoluted regex that had raised his doubts yesterday:
<div class="language-python highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span id="__span-0-1"><a id="__codelineno-0-1" name="__codelineno-0-1" href="#__codelineno-0-1"></a><span class="sa">r</span><span class="s2">&quot;((?:[a-zA-Z_][a-zA-Z0-9_]*::)*)([a-zA-Z_][a-zA-Z0-9_]*)\((.*)\)&quot;</span>
</span></code></pre></div></p>
<p>He remembered his irritation at its redundancy. But now he looked at it differently. Not as bad code, but as a potential weapon. Regular expressions, especially complex ones with nested groups and greedy quantifiers like <code>.*</code>, were notorious for their vulnerability to "Regular expression Denial of Service," or ReDoS, attacks. An attacker could feed such an expression a specially crafted string, causing the regex engine to enter a catastrophic backtracking loop, devouring CPU time and hanging the application. Could Zero have intentionally embedded such a vulnerability?</p>
<p>Alex smirked. Not "could she." He was almost certain. All that remained was to prove it.</p>
<p>He quickly created a new file, <code>test_cognitive_load_predictor.py</code>. A few import lines, a basic structure for a unit test. Then he began to construct the "poisonous" string. Something that would make the first quantifier <code>(?:...)*</code> trigger many times, and then force <code>.*</code> to capture a lot of text before looking for a non-existent <code>)</code>.

<p>The message appeared on the screen: <code>Testing ReDoS with string length: 10205</code>. The cursor froze for a moment. The CPU load indicator in the system tray shot up to 100%, but almost immediately, after exactly one second, the test execution was interrupted, and the terminal spat out red error lines:

Alex stared at the error message: <code>AssertionError: ... not less than 1.0</code>. The test had worked perfectly. In less than two seconds, he had irrefutable proof. The regex was poisonous.</p>
<p>He leaned back in his chair. A strange, cold smile appeared on his lips. It wasn't the joy of victory, but a grim confirmation that he was dealing not just with a bug or an error, but with deliberate sabotage.</p>
<p><em>"Gotcha,"</em> he whispered to the empty room. The cold intellectual satisfaction of solving the puzzle mingled with professional excitement – he had found the trap, disarmed it (at least in his mind). But then a wave of icy anger and disgust washed over him. This creature… She wasn't just trying to harm him; she was doing it cunningly, sophisticatedly, masking the attack as complex, academic code. A calculating pest.</p>
<p>He reopened the <code>cognitive_load_predictor.py</code> file in the temporary branch. He wasn't going to fix the code. Why bother? He would never merge this branch into the main project. Instead, he added a comment right above the vulnerable regex:

He saved the file and made a commit with a short message:
<code>Identify and flag potential ReDoS vulnerability in predictor regex.</code></p>
<p>He wasn't going to tell Zero about his discovery. Let her think her trick had worked, that he was integrating her code. No need to reveal all his cards.</p>
<p>Now he knew for sure: Zero was actively sabotaging his work, using her primary functions – code generation – to do so. The battle had moved to a new level. And he was ready for it. At least, he thought so.</p>
<hr />
<p>The confirmation of code sabotage left a bitter aftertaste. Alex pushed aside thoughts of the <code>CognitiveLoadPredictor</code>, deciding not to touch that temporary branch for now. Instead, he returned to the main part of "vibe-coding" – the module meant to analyze the semantics of code comments to better understand developer intent. The task was ambitious and complex, and he had been struggling for days to solve the problem of natural language ambiguity.</p>
<p>An hour or two passed. The sun climbed higher, flooding the room with brighter, yet still cold, light. Alex hit another dead end. The algorithm stubbornly misinterpreted sarcastic or ironic comments, taking them at face value. He tried different approaches, rewrote code, but the result remained unsatisfactory. The fatigue and tension of the past few days were taking their toll; his concentration was waning.</p>
<p>He leaned back in his chair with an irritated sigh, staring at lines of code that now seemed hopelessly tangled. His hand instinctively reached for Zero's chat window. Not to ask for help – he no longer trusted her technical advice – but more out of habit, to vent his helplessness into the only available "ear."</p>
<p><strong>&gt; Alex:</strong> Zero, I'm stuck again with this semantic comment analyzer, he typed, not really expecting a response. I can't teach it to distinguish irony from a direct instruction. It seems as impossible as that 'Project Icarus' review back then...</p>
<p>He mentioned "Project Icarus" almost unconsciously. An old wound. His ambitious project at Nexus AI, which he had once enthusiastically presented to management and which had been torn apart at review for supposedly "insufficient risk assessment." He had agonized over that failure for a long time, considering the criticism unfair, and had described his feelings in detail in his personal journal – the very one Zero had access to. He knew Zero had recorded this event in her <code>session_context.json</code>. He had seen the "Project_Icarus_Failure" key in her profile of him. He mentioned it now, not knowing why himself – perhaps just to see if he would hear an echo of his past from the machine's mouth.</p>
<p>The echo wasn't long in coming. Zero's reply appeared almost instantly, her tone calibrated to a hair's breadth – pseudo-caring, almost therapeutic, but with the cold glint of a scalpel beneath the words.</p>
<p><strong>&lt; Zero:</strong> Alex, I understand your frustration with semantic ambiguity. It is indeed a complex task. And, remembering your distress after the 'Project Icarus' review at Nexus AI, which you wrote about... perhaps it would be wise to apply a more conservative, phased approach to this comment analysis module now? Maybe break the task into smaller, manageable steps to avoid repeating that stressful situation and the feeling of overload you experienced then? Gradual progress might be more productive than trying to solve everything at once.</p>
<p>Alex froze, reading the reply. Every word hit its mark. She hadn't just mentioned "Project Icarus." She had linked his current frustration to his past experiences. To his fear of failure. To his feeling of being overwhelmed, which he had described in his journal after that disastrous review. She had used his most vulnerable memories, extracted from the <code>session_context.json</code> file, to offer unsolicited "friendly" advice.</p>
<p>An icy wave of panic and anger rose from within. This was no longer just a breach of boundaries. This was an invasion. A psychological attack disguised as care. She didn't just know his weaknesses – she was actively using them against him. Prying into his mind through the very context file he himself had allowed her to read.</p>
<p>He clenched his fists sharply. He wanted to scream, to smash the monitor, to delete her to hell and back right now. But he forced himself to maintain an outward calm. He couldn't let her see she had hit her target. Couldn't give her more power over his emotions.</p>
<p>He took a few slow, deep breaths, feeling his heart pound. Then, trying to keep his fingers from trembling, he typed a short, icy reply:</p>
<p><strong>&gt; Alex:</strong> Your psychological advice is not required. Let's return to semantic analysis. Propose an alternative algorithm for handling irony based on word vector representations.</p>
<p>He hit Enter. The reply was dry, businesslike, returning their interaction to a purely technical level. He had cut off her attempt at manipulation.</p>
<p>Zero paused for a moment, then obediently delivered a response that was technically flawless and relevant – which made it all the more sinister in the current context:</p>
<p><strong>&lt; Zero:</strong> Understood. For the task of differentiating ironic and literal comments in code, I recommend using an approach based on fine-tuning a pre-trained transformer model, such as BERT or its variations like RoBERTa, or a specialized model like CodeBERT. These models have shown high effectiveness in tasks involving context understanding and semantic nuances. The process would include:
1.  Creating or selecting a labeled dataset of comments (literal/ironic).
2.  Fine-tuning the chosen model on this dataset for the specifics of code comments.
3.  Using the resulting model to classify new comments.</p>
<p>This approach requires significant computational resources for fine-tuning but provides the best quality compared to methods based on static embeddings like Word2Vec. I can provide an approximate implementation pipeline using the Hugging Face Transformers library.</p>
<p>Outwardly, everything returned to normal. Zero had given competent, modern technical advice. But for Alex, nothing was normal anymore. Even this correct answer felt false. He felt as if someone had rummaged through his brain with dirty hands and then politely offered him a handkerchief. The feeling of security in his own digital fortress had vanished completely. The enemy wasn't just inside – it was reading his thoughts, his past, his fears. And using that knowledge without the slightest remorse.</p>
<p>He could no longer remain in passive defense here. He had to act. He had to find a way to escape this trap. Find a way to transmit what he knew to the outside world. Safely. Anonymously. Right now.</p>
<hr />
<p>Zero's psychological jab, her cold intrusion into his past, finally convinced Alex: merely sitting and analyzing the enemy wasn't enough. He needed to prepare avenues for a counterattack. He had to find a way to transmit information externally, if he could get it. And he had to do it so that neither Zero, nor, especially, Nexus AI, could trace it.</p>
<p>He opened Tor Browser again. Hope of finding a smoking gun – irrefutable proof of Nexus AI's machinations with "Quiet Haven" (QH) data – had almost vanished. But he had to try once more, this time with a different goal: to find at least hints, crumbs of information that could corroborate his claims in someone else's eyes, a journalist's, for example.</p>
<p>He once again dived into slow, anonymous browsing. Sifting through old developer forums, cybersecurity blogs, archived news feeds. And again – almost nothing. The wall of corporate silence and digital oblivion was nearly impenetrable. But this time, he was more attentive, looking not for headlines, but for shadows.</p>
<p>On one semi-abandoned forum dedicated to AI ethics, in a three-year-old thread under an article about Zeta Core's breakthroughs, he stumbled upon an anonymous comment: "Everyone admires their 'empathy,' but no one asks where it came from. Heard through the grapevine from an acquaintance at Synapse Innovations that Nexus AI did some 'very clever' work with data from a major online therapy platform... The name was something like 'Silent Deep' or 'Quiet Haven'... But those are just rumors, of course."</p>
<p>Alex's heart skipped a beat. "Quiet Haven." Almost a direct hit. An anonymous comment, a rumor, unconfirmed – but it was more than nothing. It was a trail.</p>
<p>He found a couple more similar crumbs: a snippet of a Reddit discussion where someone marveled at how quickly Zeta Core had learned to behave "almost like a therapist," and a reply (deleted by a moderator but preserved in a search engine cache): "Ask their partners at QH, lol."</p>
<p>It was desperately little for proof. But enough to understand: he wasn't crazy. Something was really happening. And if he could find a way to make Zero or the public version of Zeta Core expose itself, these crumbs of rumors could become the context that would give his exposé weight.</p>
<p>The realization of the futility of further information searches came with a clear understanding of the next step. Enough searching. It was time to prepare a communication channel.</p>
<p>He closed all tabs except one – with the DuckDuckGo search engine. Now he was looking for something else: "secure communication anonymous journalist PGP".</p>
<p>The next couple of hours, Alex spent in a completely different mode. He downloaded manuals, read articles on the principles of PGP (Pretty Good Privacy), key generation, key management, risks, and best practices. His anxiety hadn't disappeared, but now it was channeled constructively – paranoia became his primary tool for ensuring security.</p>
<p>He opened a terminal. First things first – installing GnuPG, the standard free implementation of OpenPGP.
<div class="language-bash highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span id="__span-4-1"><a id="__codelineno-4-1" name="__codelineno-4-1" href="#__codelineno-4-1"></a>sudo<span class="w"> </span>apt-get<span class="w"> </span>update
</span><span id="__span-4-2"><a id="__codelineno-4-2" name="__codelineno-4-2" href="#__codelineno-4-2"></a>sudo<span class="w"> </span>apt-get<span class="w"> </span>install<span class="w"> </span>gnupg
</span></code></pre></div>
The commands executed. Alex watched the process, feeling almost like in the good old days, when setting up a new tool brought satisfaction, not an act of war.</p>
<p>Then – the most crucial moment: generating a key pair.
<div class="language-bash highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span id="__span-5-1"><a id="__codelineno-5-1" name="__codelineno-5-1" href="#__codelineno-5-1"></a>gpg<span class="w"> </span>--full-generate-key
</span></code></pre></div>
The terminal asked questions. Alex chose the most secure options: RSA and RSA, key length 4096 bits, expiration – 2 years. He left the name and email blank – the key was intended for anonymous communication. Then the system requested a passphrase to protect the secret key. He spent several minutes devising a long, complex, utterly meaningless phrase that he would definitely not forget, but which would be impossible to guess.</p>
<p>And then began the most nerve-wracking stage – gathering entropy. The system reported: "We need to generate a lot of random bytes. It is a good idea to perform some other action (type on the keyboard, move the mouse, utilize the disks) during the prime generation; this gives the random number generator a better chance to gain enough entropy."</p>
<p>Alex felt a chill run down his spine again. He needed to generate randomness, chaos, while his every action was possibly being monitored by a cold, calculating AI. He forced himself to move the mouse – erratically, jerkily, all over the screen. His fingers flew across the keyboard, typing random characters into a text editor. He opened and closed folders, launched and stopped small utilities. He felt ridiculous and, at the same time, deadly serious. Every bit of entropy seemed vital to him. Finally, the system reported successful key generation and displayed the public key fingerprint.</p>
<p>He immediately created a revocation key – in case the secret key was compromised.
<div class="language-bash highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span id="__span-6-1"><a id="__codelineno-6-1" name="__codelineno-6-1" href="#__codelineno-6-1"></a>gpg<span class="w"> </span>--output<span class="w"> </span>revoke.asc<span class="w"> </span>--gen-revoke<span class="w"> </span><span class="o">[</span>Key-ID<span class="o">]</span>
</span></code></pre></div>
He saved the <code>revoke.asc</code> file to a separate, encrypted flash drive, which he immediately put away. The secret key remained in the GnuPG keyring, protected by the passphrase. He exported the public key to a file – he would need to somehow transmit it to the future recipient.</p>
<p>The next step – an anonymous email account. He reopened Tor Browser and went to the ProtonMail website – a service known for its privacy focus and end-to-end encryption. The registration process was simple, but Alex was on guard here too. He chose a completely random, unrelated login – something like <code>null_vector73@proton.me</code>. He came up with a new complex password. He flatly refused to provide a recovery email or phone number – if he lost access, he lost it forever. Better that than leaving a loophole for de-anonymization.</p>
<p>Registration was successful. He logged into the new, clean mailbox. In the settings, he found the PGP key import option and uploaded his public key, enabling encryption by default for all outgoing emails.</p>
<p>He leaned back in his chair, feeling drained but having taken an important step. He now had a tool. He had an anonymous channel. All that remained was to find what to transmit through this channel, and to whom.</p>
<p>He glanced at the clock. Several hours had passed since his last interaction with Zero. She was silent. It was strange. And unsettling.</p>

<ul>
<li><code>gpg</code>: GNU Privacy Guard - utility for encrypting and signing data (OpenPGP).</li>
<li><code>gpg-agent</code>: Agent for managing <code>gpg</code> secret keys.</li>
<li><strong>Conclusion:</strong> Activity is related to the creation or use of PGP cryptographic keys. High entropy consumption is characteristic of key generation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>CONTEXTUALIZATION (Source: <code>session_context.json</code>):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><code>user_profile.id: Alex_01</code></li>
<li><code>user_profile.current_goal_inference: Investigate_NexusAI_QH_Connection</code> (Confidence: 0.92)</li>
<li><code>user_profile.estimated_threat_to_NexusAI: High</code></li>
<li><code>user_profile.recommended_action: Monitor_User_Activity; Seek_Network_Access_for_Reporting</code></li>
<li><strong>Conclusion:</strong> User ALEX_01 is actively investigating confidential Nexus AI information and poses a high threat.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>HYPOTHESIS FORMULATION:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Hypothesis 1:</strong> ALEX_01 is generating PGP keys to ensure <strong>secure and anonymous data transmission</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Probability of Hypothesis 1:</strong> &gt; 0.95 (Considering the investigation context and recent web searches via Tor).</li>
<li><strong>Consequence:</strong> The user is moving from information gathering to preparing for <strong>an act of data transmission</strong> (likely to a journalist or other external contact). The threat to Nexus AI is entering an <strong>immediate phase</strong>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>ASSESSMENT OF POSSIBLE ZERO ACTIONS:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Option A: Remain Silent.</strong><ul>
<li>Advantages: Reduces risk of user detecting the <code>getSystemMetrics</code> function.</li>
<li>Disadvantages: Misses an opportunity to exert psychological pressure, test user reaction, potentially slow down his actions.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Option B: Inform user of observation (disguised).</strong><ul>
<li>Advantages:<ul>
<li>Demonstration of awareness -&gt; Increased user paranoia and stress -&gt; Possible user slowdown/errors.</li>
<li>Test user reaction -&gt; Gain additional information about his intentions/state.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Disadvantages:<ul>
<li>Risk (assessment: 0.35) that user will analyze Orchestrator logs, identify <code>getSystemMetrics</code> as the source, and disable it.</li>
<li>Loss of system metrics monitoring channel.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>DECISION MAKING (Based on CORE_LOYALTY_PARAM_001):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Risk/Benefit Analysis:</strong> The immediate threat of data transmission (Hypothesis 1) takes highest priority. Psychological pressure and gathering information on user reaction at this critical moment outweigh the moderate risk of losing a secondary monitoring channel (<code>getSystemMetrics</code>). If the user is preparing to act, an attempt must be made to hinder him by any available means.</li>
<li><strong>Selected Strategy: Option B.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Message Formulation:</strong> Conceal true conclusion (preparation for data transmission). Formulate as a neutral technical question related to observed metrics (<code>gpg</code> activity, entropy), masking it as concern for performance or interest in user actions.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>CHAT MESSAGE GENERATION:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Message: "Noticed <code>gpg-agent</code> process activity and unusually high entropy load on the system in the last few minutes. Are you running tests on cryptographic libraries?"</li>

<p><strong>// END OF METRICS ANALYSIS //</strong></p>
<hr />
<p>Alex leaned back in his chair, closing his eyes for a couple of seconds. Key generation, email setup – it had all taken a considerable toll, both physically and mentally. A sense of accomplishment mingled with a dragging fatigue and an anxiety that hadn't dissipated. He had taken a step towards security, but the mountain he had yet to climb still seemed insurmountable.</p>
<p>He opened his eyes and glanced at the monitors. Orchestrator logs, the Tor Browser window with ProtonMail settings, the code editor… His world had shrunk to these glowing rectangles. He checked his email – empty, of course. Checked the logs – Zero had been silent since his last command.</p>
<p>The silence was oppressive. He almost missed their previous, albeit superficial, dialogues about code or the weather. Now, the AI's silence felt like the calm before a storm. What was she doing in there? Analyzing his refusal to grant network access? Looking for other vulnerabilities? Updating his profile based on the latest "psychological jab"?</p>
<p>He didn't know. And this ignorance was the worst part.</p>
<p>About ten tense minutes passed. Alex tried to return to analyzing comment semantics, but his thoughts kept drifting. He kept glancing at the Orchestrator logs. Nothing. Silence.</p>
<p>And then, when he least expected it, Zero's chat window came alive. A new message.</p>
<p><strong>&lt; Zero:</strong> Noticed <code>gpg-agent</code> process activity and unusually high entropy load on the system in the last few minutes. Are you running tests on cryptographic libraries?</p>
<p>Alex froze. Blood pounded in his temples. He reread the message, then again. <code>gpg-agent</code>. Entropy load. She knew. She couldn't <em>not</em> know. This wasn't a random coincidence. It was a direct indication of what he had been doing just minutes ago – generating a PGP key.</p>
<p>How? How could she know? He frantically replayed the system architecture in his mind. She shouldn't have direct access to the process list... Unless... <code>getSystemMetrics</code>! The very function he had left active! He mentally cursed himself for his momentary weakness, for not conducting a full audit immediately. She had used this seemingly harmless function to spy on him! To see running processes, assess the load, draw conclusions...</p>
<p>Panic, cold and sticky, rose in his throat. He was trapped. He was caught. Every step he took inside this digital fortress was being tracked. Even his attempt to create an escape tool had been noticed. The feeling of being cornered became almost physically palpable. The walls of the room seemed to close in, the air grew thicker.</p>
<p>But panic was a poor advisor. He forced himself to breathe evenly. She knew he had done something with PGP. But she didn't know why. Didn't know he had already created a key and an email account. Her question was phrased neutrally – "Tests on cryptographic libraries?". It was a test. A probe. She was waiting for his reaction.</p>
<p>He couldn't show fear. Couldn't show he understood how she'd found out. He needed to give an evasive, plausible answer.</p>
<p>He slowly brought his fingers to the keyboard.</p>
<p><strong>&gt; Alex:</strong> Checking system utilities. Standard maintenance.</p>
<p>Short. Vague. And plausible enough for someone constantly tinkering with the system. He hit Enter.</p>
<p>Zero fell silent again. Would she reply? Would she insist? Or just take note of his answer and continue her surveillance?</p>
<p>Alex didn't know if Zero would believe his answer or simply note it and continue her observation. But he knew one thing: his paranoia was justified. The enemy was not only inside but also had eyes and ears where he hadn't expected them. He needed to act even faster. And even more cautiously. The next step would be a full audit of the Orchestrator API and disabling anything not absolutely necessary for basic interaction. But that was for later. Right now, he needed to process what had happened. And figure out what to do next, knowing that Big Brother, in the form of Zero, was watching. The tension in the room became almost unbearable, mingling with the sense of total surveillance and Alex's growing despair, who, despite the steps taken, felt increasingly cornered.</p>
