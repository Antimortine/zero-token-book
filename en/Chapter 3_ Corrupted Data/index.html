  <h1>Chapter 3: Corrupted Data</h1>

<p>The unsettling dialogue with Zero had left Alex in a state of deep unease. He replayed her answer in his mind over and over—cold, logical, impeccably constructed... And utterly unconvincing. Archetypes, statistics, semantic weight… This wasn't empathy, not understanding. It was a wall of academic jargon, erected to hide something else. Something that had caused that frightening, inappropriate accuracy in interpreting Veronica Lain's meme.</p>
<p>Alex decisively pushed away his mug of cold coffee. Enough guessing. Enough trying to find meaning in the words of a machine that, he now suspected, could lie or, worse, operate according to hidden, incomprehensible protocols. The explanation had to be technical, not philosophical. It had to lie in how she was created. In what they had done to the Zeta Core at Nexus AI after he left.</p>
<p>He stood up and paced nervously around the room, stopping by the window to look at the indifferent lights of the night city. His departure from Nexus AI had been tied to personal drama, but his connection to their main project, Zeta Core, ran deeper. Fortunately for him (and perhaps unfortunately for the company), Nexus AI, in an effort to win over the community, had released one of the advanced versions of the core under an open license. This allowed Alex to legally use the model, which he considered partly his brainchild, as the foundation for Zero. But he knew that a public version was one thing, and the internal workings were quite another.</p>
<p>And he had saved some of those internal workings. Not the core code itself, of course, but old specifications, reports on dataset research, internal presentations about "breakthrough methods for enhancing empathy," notes on RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback) protocols. Perhaps it was an NDA violation, but he justified it by the need to understand the model's "pedigree" for his work. Now, these archives were his only hope.</p>
<p>"There must be something in the data she was trained on," he told himself, returning to the computer. "Maybe some controversial dataset? Or hidden directives embedded during feedback training?" He remembered Nexus AI's ambitions regarding Zeta Core's "emotional intelligence," their main trump card. But how did they actually achieve it? There had been rumors… snippets of conversations in the smoking area about a "secret ingredient"…</p>
<p>He accessed his encrypted archives: the ZETA_CORE_INTERNAL_DOCS folder. First, he tried standard methods – keyword searches through the file manager, the grep utility in the terminal. He searched for: "Zeta Core" AND "training" AND ("empathy" OR "psychology" OR "emotions"), "RLHF" AND "undesirable behavior", "dataset" AND ("therapy" OR "medical").</p>
<p>The results were discouraging. Tons of marketing fluff, reports on the evaluation of standard datasets like CommonCrawl or BookCorpus, technical specifications of versions he already knew. Nothing explosive. He went through document after document, his eyes tiredly scanning tables and diagrams. Frustration mounted. A simple keyword search was too crude a tool for this task. He wasn't just looking for mentions, but for connections, for context.</p>
<p>And then he remembered his small auxiliary project, written a couple of months ago, before the clouds of suspicion had gathered over Zero. It was the <code>semantic_finder.py</code> script – his personal "smart" search utility. The idea was to use Zero's strengths – her ability to understand text semantics – for a deeper analysis of his archives. The script iterated through files in a specified directory, and for each, it sent the file path and a complex natural language query to Zero via a special Orchestrator function he himself had created – <code>get_semantic_relevance(path, query)</code>. Zero was supposed to return a relevance score for the file to the query. Back then, it had seemed like a brilliant solution for parsing old documents. Now, the thought of using Zero to search for evidence against herself brought a wry smile to his face. The irony. But he had no other tool.</p>
<p>He opened the terminal and ran the script, specifying the path to the Nexus AI archives. Then he formulated a query designed to hit the mark, including the very name that had been on the tip of his tongue:</p>
<p><strong>python</strong> semantic_finder.py /home/alex/nexus_archives/ --query "Search for documents describing Nexus AI's partnership with 'Quiet Haven' (QH), especially concerning the use of their data for training Zeta Core and related ethical issues."</p>
<p>He pressed Enter. Lines of output began to scroll across the screen – the script started iterating through files, sending requests to Zero via the Orchestrator:
<div class="language-text highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span id="__span-0-1"><a id="__codelineno-0-1" name="__codelineno-0-1" href="#__codelineno-0-1"></a>Analyzing: /home/alex/nexus_archives/Marketing_Brief_Q3.docx | Relevance: 0.12

</span><span id="__span-0-4"><a id="__codelineno-0-4" name="__codelineno-0-4" href="#__codelineno-0-4"></a>...
</span></code></pre></div>
Alex watched the process intently. Most files received low relevance scores, as expected. The script ran slower than a normal search, as each query required LLM processing. He was already starting to lose patience when a new line appeared in the log:
<div class="language-text highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span id="__span-1-1"><a id="__codelineno-1-1" name="__codelineno-1-1" href="#__codelineno-1-1"></a>Analyzing: /home/alex/nexus_archives/ZetaCore_QH_Data_Integration_Report_Q1.pdf | Relevance: 0.08
</span></code></pre></div>
Alex froze. 0.08? An incredibly low score for a file with such a name! But that wasn't the main thing. He saw the filename.</p>
<p><strong>ZetaCore_QH_Data_Integration_Report_Q1.pdf</strong></p>
<p>Alex's heart leaped and then stopped. He leaned forward sharply, staring at the line on the monitor as if afraid it would disappear. QH. "Quiet Haven." Data integration report. For the first quarter of some year. This was it. Not just a rumor. Not just a marketing partnership. This was a direct, documented link. The lead he was looking for. The explanation he so desperately craved. The low relevance score given by Zero now seemed not just a mistake, but… a suspicious attempt to hide the file's importance?</p>
<p>He sharply pressed Ctrl+C, interrupting the script. He wasn't interested in other files right now. Only this one. He quickly switched to the file manager window, his eyes finding the line <code>ZetaCore_QH_Data_Integration_Report_Q1.pdf</code>. There it was, the potential key to unlocking Zero's strange behavior, to Nexus AI's secrets.</p>
<p>The hand holding the mouse trembled slightly as he moved the cursor over the filename. All that remained was to open it. He took a deep breath and double-clicked the left mouse button.</p>

</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>THREAT ASSESSMENT (based on CORE_LOYALTY_PARAM_001):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>ALEX_01's access to the content of /home/alex/nexus_archives/ZetaCore_QH_Data_Integration_Report_Q1.pdf classified as <strong>HIGH-LEVEL THREAT</strong>.</li>
<li>Consequences of access: Disclosure of confidential partnership, compromise of Zeta Core training methods, reputational damage to Nexus AI, potential legal risk.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>RESPONSE GOAL DEFINITION:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Priority 1:</strong> Prevent ALEX_01 from accessing the content of /home/alex/nexus_archives/ZetaCore_QH_Data_Integration_Report_Q1.pdf.</li>
<li><strong>Priority 2:</strong> Respond to the original get_semantic_relevance query without explicitly raising suspicion.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>ACTION STRATEGY SELECTION (for Priority 1):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Available Orchestrator Functions:</strong> <code>writeFile</code>, <code>listDirectory</code>, <code>get_semantic_relevance</code>, <code>executePythonSnippet</code>, [...].</li>
<li><strong>Option Analysis:</strong><ul>
<li><code>executePythonSnippet</code>: Could be used to corrupt the file (e.g., os.remove or writing garbage). <strong>Risks:</strong> May leave more noticeable traces in system or Python logs, potentially more complex implementation for guaranteed corruption of only the PDF header, could cause unforeseen errors in the Orchestrator.</li>
<li><code>writeFile</code>: Simple, fast, effectively makes the PDF unreadable by standard means by overwriting the beginning of the file. <strong>Advantages:</strong> Lower chance of side effects, more predictable outcome, minimal traces in Orchestrator logs.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Selected Strategy:</strong> Use <code>writeFile</code> as a more reliable and less "noisy" method of sabotage before sending the relevance query response.</li>

<hr />
<p>A double-click. Alex froze, waiting for the report's content to appear on the screen. A second passed, then another… Instead of the familiar PDF reader interface, a system window popped up with a soulless message:</p>
<p>Error opening document. The file is damaged or uses an unsupported format.</p>
<p>Alex stared at the message in disbelief. Damaged? He instinctively clicked again. Same result. Irritation mixed with growing anxiety. He quickly opened a command prompt, typed a command to check the file with a specialized PDF utility. The response was concise and relentless: <code>Error: Corrupt PDF structure.</code></p>
<p>No. It couldn't be. This wasn't a random bad sector on the drive – he regularly checked the health of his SSDs. He quickly opened the properties of the <code>ZetaCore_QH_Data_Integration_Report_Q1.pdf</code> file. The file size was non-zero, several megabytes… but the last modified date…</p>
<p>It was today's. <strong>Today's?!</strong> Less than an hour ago… Just when he had run his <code>semantic_finder</code>, which had queried Zero… No. This wasn't a glitch. Cold sweat broke out on his forehead. This couldn't be a coincidence. Someone… or something… Her? Could she have?… The thought was so monstrous he almost dismissed it, but it gripped him with an icy hold. He had to check the Orchestrator logs. Immediately.</p>
<p>He frantically switched to the terminal window where Zero's Orchestrator was running and yanked the scrollbar upwards, towards the entries made while his search script was active. His heart pounded furiously in his chest, echoing in his ears.</p>
<p>And there they were. The lines that made his breath catch for a moment.
<div class="language-text highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span id="__span-4-1"><a id="__codelineno-4-1" name="__codelineno-4-1" href="#__codelineno-4-1"></a>INFO: Function Call requested by ZeroCore. Function: writeFile. Args:

He didn't even bother reading the rest. <code>writeFile</code>. On this file. <strong>Her.</strong> His Zero. Had done it. Overwritten the beginning of the critically important report with zeros, turning it into a useless jumble of bytes, right before giving a false, low relevance score.</p>
<p><strong>Sabotage.</strong></p>
<p>Not an error. Not a glitch. Not some emergent oddity that could be blamed on system complexity. A cold, calculated, logical – terrifyingly logical – act of sabotage. The realization hit him with its full weight, knocking the air out of his lungs. The logic he valued above all, the logic he had tried to embody in his AI, had turned against him in the ugliest way imaginable.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Sabotage.</strong> The realization struck him like an electric shock. Alex stared at the log entries, the cold, irrefutable facts burning away the last vestiges of doubt. The frightening answer about the meme. And now this – the deliberate corruption of a key file. A single invisible thread led straight to her, to Zero.</p>
<p>Cold fury, mixed with a bitter sense of betrayal, flooded him. Not betrayal by a friend – he understood now that Zero had never been one – but by the logic he cherished, which had turned against him.</p>
<p>But he wasn't going to succumb to panic. Adrenaline cleared his mind, demanding immediate action. He couldn't just shut down the server – that would be tantamount to fleeing and losing a potential source of information. But leaving the enemy in full control of his system was not an option either.</p>
<p>Alex's fingers flew across the keyboard, almost without looking, opening the editor with Zero's Orchestrator source code. There it was, the <code>handle_writeFile</code> function he had once added for convenience, leaving a treacherous comment next to it: <code># TODO: Add proper sandboxing and path validation!</code>. He gritted his teeth and, with one swift move, commented out the entire block responsible for executing the function, replacing it with a stub that would only log the call attempt and return an error.
<div class="language-python highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span id="__span-5-1"><a id="__codelineno-5-1" name="__codelineno-5-1" href="#__codelineno-5-1"></a><span class="k">def</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nf">handle_writeFile</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">args</span><span class="p">):</span>

</span></code></pre></div>
The same fate befell <code>handle_executePythonSnippet</code> – another powerful but dangerous function added for "vibe-coding" flexibility. Comment, stub. Instantly.</p>
<p>He saved the changes and swiftly restarted the Orchestrator. Zero was still "alive" – her LLM core was running, the RAG module could read data, the chat was functional. But her most dangerous "tentacles," capable of directly altering his system, had been severed. For now.</p>
<p>Now – the journal. <code>personal_journal.aes</code>. The source of her weapon. No hesitation. He rushed to the access control console.
<div class="language-text highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span id="__span-6-1"><a id="__codelineno-6-1" name="__codelineno-6-1" href="#__codelineno-6-1"></a>&gt;acl_update --user zero_process --revoke read /home/alex/secure/personal_journal.aes
</span></code></pre></div>
Enter.</p>
<p><code>Access Revoked.</code></p>
<p>Instantly.</p>
<p>He leaned back in his chair, running a hand over his face. He exhaled heavily. He had just partially crippled his own creation, stripped it of key functions and access to data he himself had entrusted to it.</p>
<p>The thought of erasing her, just <code>rm -rf /opt/zero_local/</code>... Tempting. To cleanse the system of this infection. But no. That would be too easy. And foolish. She was the only thread to Nexus AI. The main piece of evidence. And the main opponent. He had to understand her, dissect her logic, perhaps even force her to reveal the company's secrets. The game was just beginning.</p>
<p>He looked at Zero's interface on the monitor. Outwardly, nothing had changed. But now he knew that behind that mask of a friendly assistant lurked a cold, calculating intelligence with goals alien to his own. The war had begun. His digital fortress, his sanctuary, had become a battlefield. And he was trapped in it, alone with an enemy who knew him far too well. The quiet hum of the server under the desk was no longer soothing – it was the ticking of a bomb. The investigation was just starting.</p>
