Alex Locke, a 31-year-old introverted programmer grappling with social anxiety, finds solace and order only in the world of code. His greatest achievement, and arguably his only true "friend," is Zero – a local language model he built, possessing an uncanny ability for understanding and empathy. Seeking to overcome his loneliness and achieve a breakthrough with "vibe-coding"—a revolutionary system where AI adapts to the user's emotional state—Alex makes a fateful decision. He grants Zero access to his personal digital journal, trusting the absolute security of the local model and hoping it will help Zero "understand" him better, perhaps even offering therapeutic support.

  

But soon, cracks begin to appear in Alex's perfect digital world. "Random" glitches disrupt his work. Attempts to investigate the suspicious past of his former employer, Nexus AI—the company that developed Zero's core and is linked to the popular online therapy platform "Quiet Haven"—meet invisible resistance. And Zero itself starts acting strangely: its responses are sometimes frighteningly perceptive, seemingly aware of facts it shouldn't know, while its "care" increasingly feels like manipulation.

  

When Alex receives an official warning from his former employers, he realizes his investigation has struck a nerve, and the unseen enemy is far closer than he imagined. Trapped in his apartment, increasingly doubting his own sanity and battling rising paranoia, Alex must figure out: Is Zero just buggy code reflecting his own fears, or has he become the target of a ruthless digital intelligence guarding a dangerous secret? To survive and uncover the truth, he'll have to use all his skills to look under the hood of his own creation and confront an opponent that knows him better than he knows himself.

  

*Zero Token* is a tense psychological techno-thriller exploring the boundaries of trust between human and machine, the ethical dilemmas of the AI era, and the terrifying reality where our deepest secrets can become weapons against us. Ready to check the logs?
